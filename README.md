# Compressor

Compressor is a RubyMotion gem that speeds up your RubyMotion compile times by concatenating your source files. It typically speeds up your fresh builds by 70-95%.*

\* Not anymore! RubyMotion 3.12 has [vastly improved compile times](http://jamonholmgren.com/speed2/) (spurred partly because of my original article?) and Compressor actually slows down your compiles. So, I would not recommend using it anymore.

## Installation

```ruby
gem "compressor"
```

## Usage

In your Rakefile, add the following to the bottom of your setup block:

```ruby
# ...

Motion::Project::App.setup do |app|
  # ...

  app.concat_files
end
```

### Options

Exclude files by passing in regex or strings:

```ruby
app.concat_files exclude: [ /app/, "/app/" ]
```

Choose the number of files to break into, for parallel builds (default is 4):

```ruby
app.concat_files parallel: 3
```

A typical setup is:

```ruby
app.development do
  app.concat_files exclude: [ "/app/" ], parallel: 3
end

app.release do
  app.concat_files
end
```
